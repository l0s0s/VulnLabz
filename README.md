# VulnLabz 🧪💥

VulnLabz is a **security regression testing platform for web applications and APIs**.

It runs OWASP-style attack scenarios (SQLi, IDOR, SSRF, brute force, security headers validation, rate limiting checks) to ensure your security controls don’t break after refactors or deployments.

Think of it as **Postman + OWASP + CI regression testing**, built for automation, reporting, and DevSecOps workflows.
